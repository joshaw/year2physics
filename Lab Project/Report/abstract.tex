This report documents the building of the musical instrument known as the theremin, including the research, manufacture and subsequent testing of the product created. The instrument was made as an object intended to be understood rather than be economically or commercially viable in the form completed. Each stage was created so that it could be tested and added to the final assembly. Given more time, this could then be improved and developed into a finished product.
